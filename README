&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&


VMD


VMD must be installed prior to using viewSq. The VMD website may offer some 64-bit (strongly recommended) pre-compiled versions which can be downloaded:  https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD

There are installation instructions in the VMD README file. Typical installation instructions on a Linux machine are: using a terminal, run "./configure" from the main folder, then "cd src/", and finally (as sudo user) run "make install". VMD should now be installed and can be run in a terminal by typing "vmd".


LINUX


1. Add the following line to /usr/local/lib/vmd/scripts/vmd/loadplugins.tcl

vmd_install_extension viewsq      viewsq_tk_cb    "Analysis/viewSq"

2. Copy the folder "viewsq1.0" to /usr/local/lib/vmd/plugins/noarch/tcl

3. Copy the file "Calculate_rdf_stats_py.py" to /usr/local/lib/vmd/scripts/python

Invoke VMD and look for the plug-in under Extensions->Analysis. 

Ensure Python 3.* is the default python.


MAC


1. Add the following line to /Applications/VMD 1.9.3.app/Contents/vmd/scripts/loadplugins.tcl

vmd_install_extension viewsq      viewsq_tk_cb    "Analysis/viewSq"

2. Copy the folder "viewsq1.0" to /Applications/VMD 1.9.3.app/Contents/vmd/plugins/noarch/tcl

3. Copy the file "Calculate_rdf_stats_py.py" to /Applications/VMD 1.9.3.app/Contents/vmd/scripts/python

Ensure Python 3.* is the default python.


WINDOWS


1. Add the following line to \VMD\scripts\vmd\loadplugins.tcl

vmd_install_extension viewsq      viewsq_tk_cb    "Analysis/viewSq"

2. Copy the folder "viewsq1.0" to \VMD\plugins\noarch\tcl

3. Copy the file "Calculate_rdf_stats_py.py" to \VMD\scripts\vmd

Invoke VMD and look for the plug-in under Extensions->Analysis. When running viewSq, VMD may require you to specify the location of the Python script from step #3.
Ensure Python 3.* is in the Windows path.
