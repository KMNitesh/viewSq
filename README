viewSq is a utility for calculating, analyzing, and visualizing static structure factors (S(q)) from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

If you publish work which uses viewSq, please cite:

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&


LINUX


1. Add the following line to /usr/local/lib/vmd/scripts/vmd/loadplugins.tcl

vmd_install_extension viewsq      viewsq_tk_cb    "Analysis/viewSq"

2. Copy the folder "viewsq1.0" to /usr/local/lib/vmd/plugins/noarch/tcl

3. Copy the file "Calculate_rdf_stats_py.py" to /usr/local/lib/vmd/scripts/python

Invoke VMD and look for the plug-in under Extensions->Analysis. 


MAC


Due to memory restrictions, in order to reasonably use viewSq with over perhaps 10,000 atoms in Mac OS you will probably want to use a 64-bit VMD version. The VMD website may offer some 64-bit pre-compiled versions which can be downloaded.

1. Add the following line to /Applications/VMD 1.9.3.app/Contents/vmd/scripts/loadplugins.tcl

vmd_install_extension viewsq      viewsq_tk_cb    "Analysis/viewSq"

2. Copy the folder "viewsq1.0" to /Applications/VMD 1.9.3.app/Contents/vmd/plugins/noarch/tcl

3. Copy the file "Calculate_rdf_stats_py.py" to /Applications/VMD 1.9.3.app/Contents/vmd/scripts/python

Ensure Python 3.* is the default python.


WINDOWS


Due to memory restrictions, in order to reasonably use viewSq with over perhaps 10,000 atoms in Windows you will probably want to use a 64-bit VMD version. The VMD website may offer some 64-bit pre-compiled versions which can be downloaded.


1. Add the following line to \VMD\scripts\vmd\loadplugins.tcl

vmd_install_extension viewsq      viewsq_tk_cb    "Analysis/viewSq"

2. Copy the folder "viewsq1.0" to \VMD\plugins\noarch\tcl

3. Copy the file "Calculate_rdf_stats_py.py" to \VMD\scripts\vmd

Invoke VMD and look for the plug-in under Extensions->Analysis. When running viewSq, VMD may require you to specify the location of the Python script from step #3.
Ensure Python 3.* is in the Windows path.
